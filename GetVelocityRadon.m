function [thetas,the_t,spread_matrix]=GetVelocityRadon(data,windowsize)
%
%function applies a sliding time window over the RBCV line scan data,
%within each window a radon transform is applied to find the angle of the
%lines. The windows overlap to provide smoothing and better accuracy when
%taking the 'average angle' of the RBC shadows within each window.

%INPUTS
%data - the matrix of time X space data 
%windowsize - number of lines to use in estimating velocity.  must be a
%multiple of 4
%
%OUTPUTS
%thetas - the time varying angle of the space-time image
%the_t - time points of the angle estimates (in lines) 
%spreadmatrix - matix of variances as a function of angles at each time 
%point

%define step size for sliding window
%this is because the data will be averaged across the window, then step 1/4
%of the window and average again - this means data is overlapped in
%averaging by multiple windows, and provides a smoothing effect
%divide the no of pixels in the linescan by 4
stepsize=round(.25*windowsize); %pixels
nlines=size(data,1); %time, i.e. no Lines
npoints=size(data,2); %space, i.e. Pixels
%calculate how many steps can be taken with the step size specified and
%size of the data - this will be used for looping the data 
nsteps=floor(nlines/stepsize)-3;
%find the edges
%angle of line will not be greater than 180 degrees
%check each angle (between 0-180), to find slope of line
angles=(0:179); 
%once found crude angle, use this for FINE estimates of angle 
%(in 0.25 increments)

%create empty matrices to fill
%no steps (i.e. time windows) * how many angles to assess
spread_matrix=zeros(nsteps,length(angles));
%no steps (i.e. time windows) * how many fine angles to assess
spread_matrix_fine=zeros(nsteps,length(angles_fine));
%no steps (i.e. time window)- as will get precise angle for each step 
%(in degrees)
thetas=zeros(nsteps,1);

%hold matrix will be multiplied by the mean, for normalising later

    %sample rate

    % take info from Continuous data
    % loop through data in steps of step size * 4 
    % this will overlap by one time box on each loop

    % defaults to 0:179.
